        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <div> Sloths are a group of arboreal neotropical xenathran mammals, constituting
              the suborder Folivora. Noted for slowness of movement, they spend most of 
              their lives hanging upside down in the trees of the tropical rain forests of 
              South America and Central America. They are considered to be most closely 
              related to anteaters, together making up the xenarthran order Pilosa. There 
              are six extant sloth species in two genera – Bradypus (three–toed sloths) and 
              Choloepus (two–toed sloths). Despite this traditional naming, all sloths 
              actually have three toes on each rear limb, although two-toed sloths have only 
              two digits on each forelimb.[3] The two groups of sloths are from different,
              distantly related families, and are thought to have evolved their morphology 
              via parallel evolution from terrestrial ancestors. Besides the extant species, 
              many species of ground sloth ranging up to the size of elephants like Megatherium
             inhabited both North and South America during the Pleistocene epoch. However, 
             they became extinct during the Quaternary extinction event around 12,000 years 
             ago, together with most large bodied animals in the New World. The extinction 
             correlates in time with the arrival of humans, but climate change has also been 
             suggested to have contributed. Members of an endemic radiation of Caribbean 
             sloths formerly lived in the Greater Antilles. They included both ground and 
             arboreal forms which became extinct after humans settled the archipelago in the 
             mid-Holocene, around 6,000 years ago.</div>
